# 3D-Rasterizer Algorithm

This 3D Rasterizer Project is an innovative undertaking that involves the development and implementation of a robust graphics engine,

specifically designed to rasterize 3D objects from .obj and .ppm files. It heavily relies on the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA)

algorithm, a well-recognized technique for efficiently drawing line segments on a raster display, hence optimizing the rendering of 3D

objects. The system also incorporates backface culling, an algorithmic technique to determine and exclude the faces of 3D shapes that are

not visible to the viewer, thereby enhancing performance and computational efficiency. As a result of these technologies, 

the project delivers a streamlined and efficient system for creating and displaying high-quality, detailed 3D graphics from a variety of 

input formats.
